## 2025-05-22 - [Remove Hardcoded MAC Backdoor]
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded developer MAC address ('E0:0A:F6:C3:BA:FF') was used to bypass device registration and auto-register devices as 'DEV'.
**Learning:** Hardcoded bypasses are often left for convenience but represent a major backdoor.
**Prevention:** Use a proper device registration/approval workflow instead of hardcoded identifiers.
