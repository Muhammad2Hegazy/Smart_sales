## 2026-01-21 - [Icon-Only Button Tooltips]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in the POS system lacked tooltips, which impacts accessibility and clarity, especially in a dense interface like the sales screen.
**Action:** Always provide tooltips for icon-only buttons. Use existing localization keys (like 'reset') for tooltips on common icons (like 'clear') to improve immediate usability without adding new translation overhead when localization tools are restricted.
